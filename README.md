# Seo-Sort

This application sorts an array of numbers with Seo-Sort.
It also counts different values and displays them.
There is also a function to save those values in a .csv file.
Only positive numbers from 1 to n are used.

## How to use

### Controlls
```
Left-click:   sort
Right-click:  shuffle
Mouse-wheel:  change tupel size
```

### Variables
```
createCsv:    saves stats in a .csv file
start:        starting tupel size (only if createCsv)
end:          ending tupel size (only if createCsv)
step:         increment of the tupel size (only if createCsv)
```

The created csv file is saved in the *data* folder with a coherent file name.
